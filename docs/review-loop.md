# The builder–reviewer loop

Two long-running sessions work this repository's backlog through pull requests. A
**builder** takes work from `gh issue list`, opens PRs, and places fixes that are handed
back. A **reviewer** reads each PR, fixes what it can, and hands back what it cannot.
GitHub labels are the state machine; one comment per PR is the record. This file is the
contract. `/builder-watch` and `/reviewer-watch` in `.claude/commands/` execute it and do
not restate it.

Repository: `danieleugenewilliams/geometry-dash-game`. Base branch: `main`. Verification command: `npm test`.

## Roles

**The session name decides the role.** A session named some variation of `builder` is a
builder; one named some variation of `reviewer` is a reviewer. No session holds both — a
session that reviews its own work is not a second opinion.

## Labels

Labels live on the **PR**, not the issue. The issue is the backlog; the PR is the unit of
review. Every label below exists in the repo — confirmed with `gh label list` when this
file was generated. Never write a fourth into a prompt without creating it first.

| Label | Set by | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `ready-for-review` | builder | This PR is waiting for a reviewer. |
| `ready-to-merge` | reviewer | Reviewed and clean. The only signal that authorises a merge. |
| `changes-requested` | reviewer | Findings the reviewer could not place here. Back to the builder. |


`ready-to-merge` and `changes-requested` are mutually exclusive. A reviewer sets **at
most** one of them and removes `ready-for-review` with whichever it sets. *At most*, not
*exactly*: a reviewer that cannot vouch for what the head now contains labels nothing, and
`ready-for-review` stays on. Written as *exactly one* the rule reads as an instruction to
pick a label anyway, which is a pass over an unread diff.

Claims: One builder session dispatches everything, so a claim is held in that session's memory; a restart re-derives the queue from labels. If builders ever run in parallel, add a durable claimed label first.

## State table

Every state has one way in and one way out. `W` = `ready-for-review`, `P` =
`ready-to-merge`, `C` = `changes-requested`.

| From | Event | Who | To |
|---|---|---|---|
| (no label) | PR opened | builder | W |
| W | review passes at the head the reviewer read | reviewer | P |
| W | review finds work only the builder can place | reviewer | C |
| W | head moved during the review | reviewer | W (labels nothing; comment says so) |
| C | fix placed and pushed | builder | W |
| P | base moved (`behind_by > 0`) | builder | W — swap **before** merging forward |
| P | head pushed after the pass | builder | W — a stale pass must not outlive the pass |
| P | checks below hold | builder | merged, **P stays on** |
| any | third hand-back | either | unchanged; comment once; notify |

A merged PR keeps `ready-to-merge`. It is the only durable evidence the merged work was
reviewed, which a revert cannot recover, and closed PRs sit in no queue — every query here
filters open PRs.

## The merge predicate

A PR may merge only when **all** of these hold, re-read at merge time, not from the watch's
last tick:

1. `ready-to-merge` is on.
2. `changes-requested` is off.
3. `ready-for-review` is off. *This clause is the one that gets left out.* With only 1
   and 2, push a commit and hand the PR back, and it carries both `ready-to-merge` and
   `ready-for-review` at once — the predicate is still true and the unreviewed commit
   merges.
4. The head is the head the pass was taken at: the last `labeled ready-to-merge` event on
   the PR's timeline comes after the last commit, **and** the sha equals the one named on
   the first line of the reviewer's latest **LGTM** comment. Exact equality on both. The
   timeline orders a commit by the date it was *made*, not pushed, so the sha equality is
   the half that is exact.
5. The base is `main` and `behind_by` is 0 against it.

The **builder** merges, on `mergeable` and only after the checks below. A failed check is a refusal, never a merge on the label alone. A merge
GitHub refuses stops there and says so — no retry with different flags, no `--admin`, no
conflict resolution, never `git push origin HEAD:main`.

## Builder

Takes work from `gh issue list`, opens the PR against `main`, runs
`npm test`, labels it `ready-for-review`. Never self-reviews, however obviously
correct the work looks. A PR handed back as `changes-requested` gets the fix put where it
belongs — which may be a different PR if this repo stacks — then `changes-requested` off
and `ready-for-review` on, or the reviewer keeps polling a queue the work has dropped out
of. When a base lands, the builder swaps every child it staled: `ready-to-merge` off,
`ready-for-review` on, *then* merge the base forward. Nobody else can see that happen —
the child left the reviewer's queue when its pass was set.

## Reviewer

Polls `gh pr list --label ready-for-review`. Reviews, reproduces each finding before
believing it — *review findings are claims* — fixes what this PR introduced, verifies the
fix, runs `npm test`, and posts **one comment on that PR** with only that PR's findings
and what it changed. Then labels: `ready-to-merge` with **LGTM `<sha>`** on the first
line if nothing is outstanding; `changes-requested` with the findings listed if something
is. **The LGTM names the head it vouches for** — the sha re-read just before labelling,
which is the reviewer's own fix commit if it pushed one. An LGTM naming no sha is a pass
nobody can act on.

The reviewer verifies its own fixes, and that is deliberate. The alternative is a fourth
state and a second round trip to bless a typo. Its repairs are covered by the *verify* it
already owes, and the comment naming them is on the PR before anything merges.

`changes-requested` does not mean *the review failed*. It means *there is work here only
the builder can put in the right place*: a decision that is a person's, or a repair that
belongs in an earlier PR.

## Two sessions, one branch

A branch checks out once. The reviewer works in a **detached** worktree at the sha it
reviewed (`git worktree add --detach`), pushes with `git push origin HEAD:<branch>`, and
removes the worktree when its comment is posted. The builder fetches before touching a
branch it has handed off. Neither commits into the other's tree, and neither force-pushes:
the commit that would go is the other session's.

## The invariants the watch commands are built on

Every rule below exists because a naive version broke in a real repo, and each ships with
its reason on purpose: a rule whose reason is missing gets optimised away by the next agent
that reads it. *An agent that reads a reason it can see is false skips the step.*

1. **The session name decides the role, and no session holds both.** A session that
   reviews its own work is not a second opinion.
2. **Key the watch on the item number *and* the head commit.** Number alone is silent when
   something already in the queue is pushed to — which is the second round, every time.
3. **A failed poll publishes nothing and leaves the previous state alone.** Swallowing an
   API error into an empty result overwrites the state with nothing, and the next good tick
   re-emits the whole queue as new work: a second review, a second comment, a second label
   swap on work already done.
4. **Sleep on every path, including the error path.** A `continue` that skips the sleep
   spins the API.
5. **Name the repo in every call.** A bare `gh pr list` resolves from the working directory
   and exits 1 anywhere else, which rule 3 then turns into a tick skipped forever.
6. **Bound every list explicitly.** `gh pr list` defaults to 30 and says nothing about what
   it dropped. A queue of 31 reviews 30 and leaves one invisible for as long as the queue
   stays full.
7. **Break the silence when polls keep failing.** Publishing nothing on a failure is right;
   doing it forever is not. Count consecutive failures, emit once at five, reset on the
   first good poll. Silence and an empty queue are the same picture.
8. **Ask state questions, never history.** "Which open items are behind their base"
   survives a restart and has no replay. "Which merged recently" re-emits everything on
   every arm — one repo replayed nine landed PRs every time the watch started.
9. **Cap on queue membership, loop-wide — never per item.** A per-item cap does not bound
   a loop: one repo's spiral was nine separate pull requests, each resetting the counter.
   A repo that stacks PRs is worse exposed, because one merge stales every child and each
   re-enters the queue.
10. **Hold the cap's slot for the whole round.** Freeing it when a round starts bounds
    nothing.
11. **Publish the held count every tick, including zero.** A diff-based emitter only
    publishes additions, so a count falling to zero says nothing and the last thing anyone
    heard is the backlog at its worst.
12. **Read the hand-back count off the item's own timeline, paginated, never from session
    memory.** The GitHub timeline pages at 30 ascending, so an un-paginated count drops the
    *most recent* events — and an item handed back three times is exactly the one long
    enough to lose them. Measured on one PR: 2 events un-paginated, 5 across all pages. A
    cap that reads 2 when the truth is 5 says *fine* when it means *I could not tell*.
13. **A round claims the item it is working on.** The window between pushing a fix and
    swapping the label is minutes, against a poll measured in minutes, so a second round on
    a live round is the common path rather than an edge.
14. **A round must be resumable from the item alone.** Labels are the state, one comment
    per item is the record. Test it by clearing context mid-queue and seeing whether the
    next round proceeds.
15. **Hand every round to a subagent and keep only the event line.** The diff, the file
    reads and the finding text never enter the watching session, which is what lets the
    watch run all day. This is the whole token argument.
16. **One detached worktree per round, removed when the round ends.** Detached because a
    branch checks out once and the other session is probably holding it. Removed because
    nothing complains if you don't — thirteen abandoned trees accumulated in one repo
    before anyone looked.
17. **Re-read the head before labelling, and compare against the head this round recorded,
    not the one the event carried.** A review that fixed something has already moved the
    head with its own commit.
18. **Never force-push past a rejection.** The commit that would go is the other session's.
19. **Stop after three hand-backs, say so once, and notify.** Two agents can pass work back
    and forth forever. Once, because the item stays in the queue and every new session
    re-emits it, and a notification that repeats is one the person learns to ignore.
20. **Say when the watch stops.** A stopped watch and an empty queue look identical.

## What this loop does not give you

- **`allowed-tools` is pre-approval, not a deny.** A call outside the list prompts a
  person; under bypassed permissions it stops nothing. It removes the silent path.
- **`git push origin HEAD:*` admits `HEAD:main`**, which lands everything and
  skips every check. No glob admits arbitrary runtime branch names while excluding the base
  branch. The two real repairs are decisions, not edits: drop the push glob and let every
  push prompt, or add a `PreToolUse` hook that refuses pushes to `main`. Branch
  protection on the remote is the third and the only one enforced off this machine.
- **The loop converges; it does not decide.** Nothing here can mechanise "this feature is
  good enough." A third hand-back is where a person comes in.
