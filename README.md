# 🎮 Geometry Dash Clone - A Coding Adventure!

Welcome to our homeschool coding project! This is a fun game that teaches us how to build apps and games using modern tools like AI assistants.

## 🌟 What is This Game?

This is our version of the popular game "Geometry Dash" where you control a blue square that jumps over spikes and climbs stairs. It's like teaching a character to run, jump, and avoid obstacles - just like in a video game!

### 🎯 Learning Goals

**For Kids (Ages 7-9):**
- Learn how computers make games work
- Understand how characters move and jump
- See how we can ask AI to help us code
- Practice breaking big problems into small steps

**For Adults:**
- Modern web development with HTML5 Canvas
- Game physics and collision detection
- AI-assisted prototyping and development
- Iterative product development approach

## 🕹️ How to Play

### Controls
- **Space Bar** or **Up Arrow**: Make the blue square jump
- **R Key**: Turn auto-replay on/off (game restarts automatically when you crash)
- **P Key**: Pause and unpause the game

### Game Rules
- **Red Triangles** (spikes): Don't touch these! Game over if you hit them
- **Brown Rectangles** (stairs): You can jump on top of these safely
- **BUT**: If you run into the side of a stair, game over!
- The game gets harder as you go - more obstacles appear!

## 🚀 How to Run the Game

### Easy Way (For Beginners)
1. Download the `index.html` file
2. Double-click it - it will open in your web browser
3. Start playing!

### Developer Way (For Learning)
1. Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
2. Navigate to the game folder: `cd path/to/geometry-dash-game`
3. Start a web server: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
4. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000`

### With High Score System (New!)
1. Install Node.js if not already installed
2. Start the server: `npm start` or `node server.js`
3. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000`

## 🏗️ How the Game Works (Kid-Friendly Explanation)

Think of building this game like creating a cartoon! Here's how we made it:

### 1. **The Canvas** 🎨
- Like a digital piece of paper where we draw everything
- Every frame (60 times per second!), we erase and redraw the whole picture
- This makes it look like things are moving

### 2. **The Blue Square (Player)** 🟦
```javascript
let player = {
    x: 100,           // How far right on the screen
    y: 270,           // How far down on the screen  
    width: 30,        // How big (width)
    height: 30,       // How big (height)
    velocityY: 0,     // How fast moving up/down
    isJumping: false  // Is it in the air?
}
```

### 3. **Gravity** ⬇️
- Just like in real life, things fall down!
- Every frame, we add a little bit of downward speed
- When you jump, we give the square upward speed
- Gravity pulls it back down

### 4. **Collision Detection** 💥
This is like asking: "Is the blue square touching a red spike?"
- We check if their positions overlap
- If yes = Game Over!
- If the square lands on TOP of a stair = Safe!
- If the square hits the SIDE of a stair = Game Over!

### 5. **Game Loop** 🔄
The computer does this 60 times every second:
1. **Update**: Move everything, check for crashes
2. **Draw**: Paint everything on the screen
3. **Repeat**: Do it again!

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development Story

This project demonstrates modern software development using AI tools:

### How We Built This Together

1. **Started Simple**: "Let's make a Geometry Dash game!"
2. **Asked AI for Help**: Used AI to write the initial game code
3. **Tested and Improved**: Played the game, found bugs, asked AI to help identify cause and fix them
4. **Added Features Step by Step**:
   - ✅ Basic jumping and gravity
   - ✅ Red spike obstacles  
   - ✅ Brown stair platforms
   - ✅ Auto-replay feature
   - ✅ Pause functionality
   - ✅ Easier starting section
   - ✅ Portal flying mechanics
   - ✅ Gold coin collection system
   - ✅ High score system with file saving

### AI Development Process

**Human**: "The game is too hard at the start"
**AI**: "I'll remove the first obstacles to make it easier"
**Human**: "Add stairs the player can jump on"
**AI**: "I'll create brown rectangular stairs with landing detection"
**Human**: "Add a high score system that saves to a file"
**AI**: "I'll create a Node.js server to handle file operations"

This shows how we can:
- Break complex problems into small pieces
- Iterate quickly with AI assistance
- Test ideas fast and improve them
- Learn by doing and experimenting

## 📚 What Technologies Did We Use?

### For Kids:
- **HTML**: The structure (like the frame of a house)
- **CSS**: The style (like paint and decorations)
- **JavaScript**: The brain (makes everything work and move)

### For Adults:
- **HTML5 Canvas**: 2D graphics rendering
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Game logic, physics, event handling
- **CSS3**: Basic styling and layout
- **Node.js**: Server-side file operations for high scores
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaboration
- **AI Assistant**: Code generation and debugging

## 🧪 Experiments You Can Try

### Easy Changes:
1. **Change Colors**: Find `ctx.fillStyle = 'blue'` and try 'red', 'green', or 'purple'
2. **Make Jumps Higher**: Change `JUMP_FORCE = -15` to `-20` for super jumps!
3. **Slower Gravity**: Change `GRAVITY = 0.8` to `0.5` for moon gravity

### Medium Changes:
1. **Add Sound Effects**: Research `new Audio()` in JavaScript
2. **Change the Player**: Make it a circle instead of a square
3. **New Obstacle Types**: Create different colored spikes

### Advanced Projects:
1. **Power-ups**: Add items that give special abilities
2. **Background Animation**: Moving clouds or stars
3. **Multiple Levels**: Different obstacle patterns
4. **Multiplayer**: Two players on the same screen

## 🎓 Learning Concepts Covered

### Programming Concepts:
- **Variables**: Storing information (player position, score)
- **Functions**: Reusable pieces of code (checkCollision, draw)
- **Loops**: Repeating actions (game loop, drawing obstacles)
- **Conditionals**: Making decisions (if jumping, if collision)
- **Objects**: Organizing related data (player, obstacles)

### Game Development:
- **Game Physics**: Gravity, collision detection
- **Game States**: Playing, paused, game over
- **User Input**: Keyboard controls
- **Animation**: 60fps refresh rate
- **Procedural Generation**: Creating obstacles dynamically

### Problem Solving:
- **Decomposition**: Breaking the game into smaller parts
- **Pattern Recognition**: Similar code for obstacles and stairs
- **Debugging**: Finding and fixing problems
- **Iteration**: Improving the game step by step

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Game won't start?**
- Make sure you're opening `index.html` in a web browser
- Try using the local server method instead

**Controls not working?**
- Click on the game area first
- Make sure you're using Space, Up Arrow, R, or P keys

**Game running too fast/slow?**
- This depends on your computer's speed
- Try adjusting the `MOVE_SPEED` value in the code

**High scores not saving?**
- Make sure you're running the Node.js server (`npm start`)
- Check that the server is running on port 3000

## 🌈 Next Steps

1. **Play and Explore**: Try all the controls and features
2. **Read the Code**: Open `index.html` and see how it works
3. **Make Changes**: Start with simple color or number changes
4. **Ask Questions**: What would you like to add or change?
5. **Share Your Creation**: Show friends and family what you built!
